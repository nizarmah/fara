# fara

Fara is a tool to control the mouse with gestures.

I woke up with a dead trackpad, and built it instead of buying a new one.

## Quick Start

Install [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) if you haven't already.

```bash
make run
```

## Controls

1. Left Click: pinch (thumb + index/middle finger)
2. Right ClicK: pinch (thumb + pinky)
3. Drag: pinch and hold
4. Scroll: fist and pull up/down

## Disclaimer

This is still extremely early days.
The current proof of concept was written by AI.

I needed something extremely quickly, because well I had no mouse.
I'll make it better, slowly, because I'm using this personally.

Heads up, this might not stay in Python. It might get re-written in Go.
